The repo is the implementation of the CLISA model for "Contrastive Learning of Subject-Invariant EEG Representations for Cross-Subject Emotion Recognition". 

See the paper on https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09559

The model is based on PyTorch 1.7.1, Python 3.8.10, and Matlab R2020b.

For the generic cross-subject emotion recognition task on the SEED dataset, the steps for running the model are as follows:
1. Run run_cl_de_norm.py in python for contrastive learning, extracting DE features, and adaptive normalization. This process will take hours (around two hours on our server) to run.
2. Run smooth_features_de_seed.m in matlab for smoothing by linear dynamical systems.
3. Run run_classifier.py in python for MLP classifier with extrated features as input.

For the generalizability test for unseen emotional stimuli of testing subjects on the SEED dataset, the steps for running the model are as follows:
1. Run run_cl_de_norm_sepVideo.py in python for contrastive learning (only on training videos of training subjects), extracting DE features, and adaptive normalization.
2. Run smooth_features_de_seed_sepVideo.m in matlab for smoothing by linear dynamical systems.
3. Run run_classifier.py in python for MLP classifier with extrated features as input.
